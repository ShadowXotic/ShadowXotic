- 👋 Hi, I’m @ShadowXotic
- 👀 I’m interested in creating projects that would be nicely interactive.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, and JS, and improving in python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on productive projects such as python-coded robots, quizzes, trivia, dictionaries, and games.
- 📫 How to reach me: vivek4shadowxaos@gmail.com 
- 😄 Pronouns: Confident, determined, interested.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have participated in a National-wide Competition in a Student Organization called SkillsUSA. I have achived the bronze award in regionals and silver award in states in the 20-second elevator story. States was the highest level for this competition, and I am glad to finish the competition at the top 3 level in both regionals and states.
